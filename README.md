# TableTopRPG_Helper
This repository is the starting point of a java application to help players of a Dungeons and Dragons game see a virtual player sheet.
The end product will include a GUI interface to easily change stats, equipment, and keep all handbook references recorded.
The hope is also to add a Web framework so the DM can see all the player's stats and be able to save encounters, monster stats, etc.
